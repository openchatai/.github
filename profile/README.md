Hi there 👋,


### ❤️ Open source

We are a small team of hardcore engineers, we love open source and believe in building AI products that benefit humanity.




### 🍿 Optimize for the long run
Our goal is to make complex UIs something from the past, why do I have to click 100 something on Jira to do a task? I just should say what I want!
